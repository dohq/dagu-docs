# Changelog

## v1.30.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Added

- **Per-DAG Prometheus Metrics**: Enhanced observability with granular per-DAG metrics and histograms. (#1411)
  - `dagu_dag_runs_currently_running_by_dag` - Running count per DAG
  - `dagu_dag_runs_queued_by_dag` - Queue depth per DAG
  - `dagu_dag_runs_total_by_dag` - Run counts by DAG and status
  - `dagu_dag_run_duration_seconds` - Duration histogram per DAG
  - `dagu_queue_wait_seconds` - Queue wait time histogram per DAG

  See [Prometheus Metrics](/features/prometheus-metrics) for full documentation.

- **Container Exec Mode**: Execute commands in already-running containers instead of creating new ones. This enables running workflows in containers started by Docker Compose or other orchestration tools. (#1515)

  **String form** - exec with container's default settings:
  ```yaml
  container: my-running-container

  steps:
    - command: php artisan migrate
    - command: php artisan cache:clear
  ```

  **Object form** - with user, workingDir, and env overrides:
  ```yaml
  container:
    exec: my-running-container
    user: root
    workingDir: /var/www
    env:
      - APP_DEBUG=true

  steps:
    - command: composer install
  ```

  Exec mode works at both DAG-level and step-level. The container must be running; Dagu waits up to 120 seconds for the container to be in running state.

  See [Container Field](/writing-workflows/container#exec-mode-use-existing-container) for full documentation.

- **Worker ID Tracking**: Added worker ID tracking to DAG runs for distributed setups. Users can now see which worker executed their jobs in both the DAG runs list and detail views. (#1500)
  - Local execution displays `local` as the worker ID
  - Distributed execution displays the worker ID (format: `{hostname}@{pid}`)
  - Worker ID is shown in the DAG runs table and run details panel

### Changed

- **Metrics Endpoint Access Control**: The `/api/v2/metrics` endpoint now requires authentication by default for improved security. Configure `metrics: "public"` or set `DAGU_SERVER_METRICS=public` to restore the previous public access behavior. When private, use API tokens or basic auth for Prometheus scraping. (#1411)

  ```yaml
  # Require authentication (new default)
  metrics: "private"

  # Allow public access (previous behavior)
  metrics: "public"
  ```

  See [Prometheus Metrics](/features/prometheus-metrics) for configuration examples.

### Fixed

- **Multiple dotenv files**: Fixed loading of multiple `.env` files. Previously, only the first file was processed. Now all files are loaded sequentially, with later files overriding values from earlier ones. Duplicate file paths are automatically deduplicated. Note: `.env` is always prepended to the list unless `dotenv: []` is specified. (#1519)

  ```yaml
  # All files are now loaded, with later files overriding earlier ones
  dotenv:
    - .env.defaults    # .env loaded first (auto-prepended), then this
    - .env.local       # Overrides earlier files
    - .env.production  # Overrides all earlier files
  ```

## v1.29.0 (2025-12-28)

### Added
- Spec: Added `logOutput` field at DAG and step levels to control stdout/stderr logging behavior - `separate` (default) writes to separate `.out`/`.err` files, `merged` writes both to a single `.log` file with interleaved output (#1505)
- **DAG Run Outputs Collection**: Collect step outputs into a structured `outputs.json` file per DAG run. View collected outputs in the Web UI via the new Outputs tab. (#1466)
  - Outputs are automatically collected from steps with `output` field
  - Secret values are automatically masked in outputs
  - Enhanced `output` field syntax supports object form with `name`, `key`, and `omit` options:

```yaml
steps:
  # Simple string form (existing behavior)
  - name: get-count
    command: echo "42"
    output: COUNT

  # Object form with custom key
  - name: get-version
    command: cat VERSION
    output:
      name: VERSION
      key: appVersion  # Custom key in outputs.json (default: camelCase of name)

  # Object form with omit
  - name: internal-step
    command: echo "processing"
    output:
      name: TEMP
      omit: true  # Exclude from outputs.json but still usable in DAG
```

  - API endpoint: `GET /api/v2/dag-runs/{name}/{dagRunId}/outputs`
  - See [DAG Run Outputs](/features/outputs) for full documentation
- UI: Added wrap/unwrap toggle button in log viewer for better readability of long lines
- **API Key Management**: Added comprehensive API key management for programmatic access with role-based permissions. API keys provide a secure alternative to static tokens with fine-grained access control.
  - Create, list, update, and delete API keys via Web UI or REST API
  - Role-based permissions (admin, manager, operator, viewer) per key
  - Usage tracking with `lastUsedAt` timestamp
  - Secure key generation with bcrypt hashing
  - Keys use `dagu_` prefix for easy identification
  - Web UI management at Settings > API Keys (admin only)
  - Full REST API at `/api/v2/api-keys` endpoints

```bash
# Create an API key
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v2/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "ci-pipeline", "role": "operator"}'

# Use the API key
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dagu_your-key-here" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v2/dags
```

Requires builtin authentication mode (`auth.mode: builtin`). See [API Keys documentation](/configurations/authentication/api-keys) for details.

- **Webhook Management**: Added DAG-specific webhooks for triggering workflow executions from external systems like CI/CD pipelines, GitHub, and Slack.
  - Create, regenerate, enable/disable, and delete webhooks via Web UI or REST API
  - DAG-specific tokens (one webhook per DAG) with `dagu_wh_` prefix
  - Payload passthrough via `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD` environment variable
  - Idempotent execution support with custom `dagRunId`
  - Usage tracking with `lastUsedAt` timestamp
  - Secure token storage with bcrypt hashing
  - Full REST API at `/api/v2/webhooks` and `/api/v2/dags/{fileName}/webhook` endpoints

```bash
# Create a webhook for a DAG
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v2/dags/my-dag/webhook \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"

# Trigger DAG via webhook with payload
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v2/webhooks/my-dag \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dagu_wh_your-webhook-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"payload": {"branch": "main", "commit": "abc123"}}'
```

Requires builtin authentication mode (`auth.mode: builtin`). See [Webhooks documentation](/configurations/authentication/webhooks) for details.

- **Multiple Commands per Step**: Steps can now execute multiple commands sequentially using an array syntax. This allows sharing step configuration (`env`, `workingDir`, `retryPolicy`, `preconditions`, `container`, etc.) across multiple commands instead of duplicating it across separate steps.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: build-and-test
    command:
      - npm install
      - npm run build
      - npm test
    env:
      - NODE_ENV: production
    workingDir: /app
```

Commands run in order and stop on first failure. Retries restart from the first command (no checkpoint/resume from middle).

Supported executors: shell, command, docker, container, ssh. Executors that do not support multiple commands (jq, http, archive, mail, github_action, dag) will reject the configuration at parse time.

### Fixed
- Config: Fixed `errorMail` and `infoMail` partial field overrides not working when only specifying `prefix` or `attachLogs` without `from`/`to` fields. Previously, single-field overrides were silently ignored. (#1512)
- Config: Fixed `smtp` partial field overrides not working when only specifying `username` or `password` without `host`/`port` fields.


## v1.28.0 (2025-12-24)

### Added
- **Step-Level Container Field**: Added `container` field for individual steps, providing the same configuration options as DAG-level container but for per-step container execution. This is the recommended way to run steps in containers, replacing the verbose `executor: docker` syntax.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: build
    container:
      image: node:24
      volumes:
        - ./src:/app
      workingDir: /app
    command: npm run build

  - name: test
    container:
      image: python:3.11
      env:
        - PYTHONPATH=/app
    command: pytest
```

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Updated all documentation to use the new step-level `container` syntax instead of `executor: docker`
- **JSON Schema**: Updated DAG schema to include step-level `container` field with proper validation
- **Spec Refactor (internal)**: Restructured spec types and build logic for improved maintainability (#1499)
- **UI**: Removed link to Discord and Github from the frontend

### Validation
- Added validation to prevent using `container` field together with `executor` field (conflicting execution methods)
- Added validation to prevent using `container` field together with `script` field (scripts not supported in containers)


## v1.27.0 (2025-12-21)

### Added
- CLI: Added `cleanup` command for removing old DAG-run data for specified DAG-name

### Fixed
- Runtime, API: Fix issues that a DAG run often fails due to max active run check

## v1.26.7 (2025-12-20)

### Added
- Runtime: Add support for multi-level nested DAG execution
- Spec: Add `containerName` field to DAG-level `container` field

## v1.26.4 (2025-12-14)

### Added
- API: Added optional `singleton` flag to `POST /dags/{fileName}/enqueue` endpoint to prevent duplicate runs when a DAG is already executing or queued; returns HTTP 409 Conflict when enabled and active/queued runs exist (#1483, #1460)

### Changed
- Deps: Upgraded gopsutil from v3 to v4 (#1470)
  - Note: On Linux, `UsedPercent` for memory now derives from `MemAvailable` rather than the previous method, which may alter reported values by 6-10%
- Release: Removed NetBSD from release targets

### Fixed
- Scheduler: Queue processor now respects `maxConcurrency` configuration in global config for DAG-based queues (#1482)
- Runtime: Fixed dequeue command missing queue name parameter, causing API-based dequeue operations to fail (#1481)
- Auth: API token authentication now works alongside builtin authentication mode; unified middleware supports JWT Bearer tokens, API tokens, Basic auth, and OIDC simultaneously (#1480, #1478, #1475)
- UI: User Management menu now only displays for admin users when authentication mode is "builtin"; reset password functionality restricted to admin users (#1484)
- Runtime: Special environment variables (`DAG_RUN_ID`, `DAG_NAME`, etc.) now work correctly in `handlerOn.exit` and other handler contexts (#1474)
- Security: Escaped config path strings injected into HTML templates to prevent potential JavaScript injection vulnerabilities on Windows (#1472)

## v1.26.2 (2025-12-10)

### Added
- Spec: Added optional `negate` flag for preconditions at both DAG and step levels to invert condition evaluation (#1451)

## v1.24.5

### Changed
- Status: Renamed the `canceled` lifecycle label to `aborted` across the CLI, runtime, APIs, schemas, and UI so status analytics and automations reference a single canonical value.

### Fixed
- Docker executor: Preserve step-level container entrypoints so step commands can rely on the image's default binary (#1403)
- Auth/API: Add configurable public paths so `/api/v*/health` bypasses authentication for uptime probes by default (#1404)
- Auth/OIDC: Guard verifier initialization so unreachable issuers fail gracefully instead of crashing the server (#1407)

- Installer: Added a `--working-dir` flag to place temporary files outside `/tmp`, useful on constrained systems (#1388)
- Spec: Resolve parameter schema references relative to the process cwd, declared `workingDir`, or the DAG file location so JSON Schema files can be co-located with DAGs (#1371)

### Fixed
- UI: Ensure repeat-policy sub DAG run lists refresh their timestamps and counts without needing a window refocus by polling `/sub-dag-runs` while expanded (#1389)
- Spec/UI: Stabilize default parameter ordering so Start DAG modal fields stay in place while editing (#1395)
- OIDC: Automatically clear expired dashboard cookies and restart the auth flow so stale tokens no longer block the UI after restarts (#1394)

- UI: Enhanced sub DAG run display with execution timeline showing datetime, status indicators, and lazy loading of execution details (#1041)
- API: Added `POST /api/v2/dag-runs/{name}/{dagRunId}/reschedule` endpoint for replaying runs while enforcing singleton mode to block reschedules when the DAG already has active or queued runs (#1347)
- API: Added `POST /api/v2/dag-runs/enqueue` to enqueue DAG-runs directly from inline YAML specs without creating DAG files, including optional queue overrides (#1375)
- CLI: Added `--from-run-id` flag to `dagu start` for cloning historic runs with their saved parameters (#1378)
- CLI: Added `dagu exec` command to run shell commands without writing YAML files, with full logging, history, environment control, and queue support (#1348)
- UI: Added grouped view with preset and specific date range selectors on the DAG-runs page for faster historical exploration (#1377)
- Executors: Added an archive executor (`type: archive`) with extract, create, and list operations

### Improved
- UI: Persisted DAG/queue/search filters across navigation using a remote-aware search state provider so bookmarked URLs and session filters stay aligned (#1379)

### Fixed
- Windows: Restored queued DAG execution by exporting the necessary environment variables when spawning processes from the queue runner (#1373)
- UI: Fixed DAG rendering while zooming out (#1380)

**Full Changelog**: [v1.23.0...v1.23.1](https://github.com/dagu-org/dagu/compare/v1.23.0...v1.23.1)

## v1.23.0 (2025-10-21)

### Changed
- Status: Adopted canonical lowercase tokens for DAG and node lifecycle states (`not_started`, `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `partially_succeeded`, `failed`, `canceled`), and updated API examples, docs, and telemetry labels to match.
- Security: Implemented security filtering for system environment variables passed to step processes and sub DAGs. System variables remain available for expansion (`${VAR}`) during DAG configuration parsing, but only whitelisted variables (`PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, `TZ`, `SHELL`) and variables with allowed prefixes (`DAGU_*`, `LC_*`, `DAG_*`) are passed to the step execution environment. This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive credentials to subprocess environments. Other variables must be explicitly defined in the workflow's `env` section to be available in step processes.
- Scheduler: Queue handler now processes items asynchronously, acknowledging work before heartbeat checks so long-running startups no longer starve the queue.
- Runtime: Subcommand execution inherits the filtered base environment and uses the caller's working directory.

### Added
- CLI: Added `--dagu-home` global flag to override the application home directory on a per-command basis. Useful for testing, running multiple instances with isolated data, and CI/CD scenarios.
- CLI: Added `dagu validate` command to validate DAG specifications without executing them. Prints human‑readable errors and exits with code 1 on failure.
- API: Added `POST /api/v2/dags/validate` to validate DAG YAML. Returns `{ valid: boolean, errors: string[], dag?: DAGDetails }`.
- API: `POST /api/v2/dags` now accepts optional `spec` to initialize a DAG. The spec is validated before creation and returns 400 on invalid input.
- API: Added `POST /api/v2/dag-runs` to create and start a DAG-run directly from an inline YAML `spec` without persisting a DAG file. Supports optional `name`, `params`, `dagRunId`, and `singleton`.
- API: Added `nextRun` sort option to `GET /api/v2/dags` to sort DAGs by their next scheduled run time. DAGs with earlier next runs appear first in ascending order, and DAGs without schedules appear last.
- Steps: Add support for shebang detection in `script`.
- Steps: Multi-line `command` strings now execute as inline scripts, including support for shebang.
- DAG: Introduced a `secrets` block that references external providers (built-in `env` and `file`) and resolves values at runtime with automatic log/output masking.
- Parameters: Added JSON Schema validation mode with `schema`.
- Runtime: Injects `DAG_RUN_STATUS` into handler environments so exit/success/failure/cancel scripts can branch on the final canonical status.
- Executors: Added an experimental GitHub Actions executor (`type: gha`) powered by nektos/act; action inputs come from the new step-level `params` map.
- UI: Added accordion-style expandable node rows to display step logs inline, similar to GitHub Actions, reducing the need to open popup windows (#1313).

### Fixed
- DAG name validation is centralized and enforced consistently: names must be `<= 40` chars and match `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+`. Endpoints that accept `name` now return `400 bad_request` for invalid names.
- Docker: Fixed container initialization bug with `registryAuths` field (#1330)
- Windows: Fixed process cancellation not terminating subprocesses by recursively killing all child processes (#1342)
- UI: Fixed duration display update bug in DAG run details
- Other small issues and improvements

## v1.17.0 (2025-06-18)

### Major Features

####  Improved Performance
- Refactored execution history data for more performant history lookup
- Optimized internal data structures for better scalability

####  Hierarchical DAG Execution
Execute nested DAGs with full parameter passing and output bubbling:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: run_sub-dag
    run: sub-dag
    output: OUT
    params: "INPUT=${DATA_PATH}"

  - name: use output
    command: echo ${OUT.outputs.RESULT}
```

####  Multiple DAGs in Single File
Define multiple DAGs in one YAML file using `---` separator:
```yaml
name: main-workflow
steps:
  - name: process
    run: sub-workflow  # Defined below

---

name: sub-workflow
steps:
  - name: task
    command: echo "Hello from sub-workflow"
```

####  Parallel Execution with Parameters
Execute commands or sub-DAGs in parallel with different parameters for batch processing:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: get files
    command: find /data -name "*.csv"
    output: FILES
  
  - name: process files
    run: process-file
    parallel: ${FILES}
    params:
      - FILE_NAME: ${ITEM}
```

####  Enhanced Web UI
- Overall UI improvements with better user experience
- Cleaner design and more intuitive navigation
- Better performance for large DAG visualizations

####  Advanced History Search
New execution history page with:
- Date-range filtering
- Status filtering (success, failure, running, etc.)
- Improved search performance
- Better timeline visualization

####  Better Debugging
- **Precondition Results**: Display actual results of precondition evaluations in the UI
- **Output Variables**: Show output variable values in the UI for easier debugging
- **Separate Logs**: stdout and stderr are now separated by default for clearer log analysis

####  Queue Management
Added enqueue functionality for both API and UI:
```bash
# Queue a DAG for later execution
dagu enqueue --run-id=custom-id my-dag.yaml

# Dequeue
dagu dequeue default
```

####  Partial Success Status
New "partial success" status for workflows where some steps succeed and others fail, providing better visibility into complex workflow states.

####  API v2
- New `/api/v2` endpoints with refactored schema
- Better abstractions and cleaner interfaces
- Improved error handling and response formats
- See [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/dagu-org/dagu/blob/main/api/v2/api.yaml) for details

### Docker Improvements

####  Optimized Images
Thanks to @jerry-yuan:
- Significantly reduced Docker image size
- Split into three baseline images for different use cases
- Better layer caching for faster builds

####  Container Enhancements
Thanks to @vnghia:
- Allow specifying container name
- Support for image platform selection
- Better container management options

### Enhanced Features

####  Advanced Repeat Policy
Thanks to @thefishhat:
- **Enhanced in v1.17.5**: Explicit 'while' and 'until' modes for clear repeat logic
- Conditions for repeat execution
- Expected output matching  
- Exit code-based repeats

```yaml
steps:
  - name: wait for service
    command: check_service.sh
    repeatPolicy:
      repeat: until        # NEW: Explicit mode (while/until)
      condition: "${STATUS}"
      expected: "ready"    # Repeat UNTIL status is ready
      intervalSec: 30
      limit: 60           # Maximum attempts
      
  - name: monitor process
    command: pgrep myapp
    repeatPolicy:
      repeat: while       # Repeat WHILE process exists
      exitCode: [0]       # Exit code 0 means found
      intervalSec: 10
```

### Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed history data migration issues
- Improved error messages and logging
- Better handling of edge cases in DAG execution
- Performance improvements for large workflows
- Various UI/UX enhancements: #925, #898, #895, #868, #903, #911, #913, #921, #923, #887, #922, #932, #962

### Breaking Changes

####  DAG Type Field (v1.17.0-beta.13+)

Starting from v1.17.0-beta.13, DAGs now have a `type` field that controls step execution behavior:

- **`type: chain`** (new default): Steps are automatically connected in sequence, even if no dependencies are specified
- **`type: graph`** (previous behavior): Steps only depend on explicitly defined dependencies

To maintain the previous behavior, add `type: graph` to your DAG configuration:

```yaml
type: graph
steps:
  - name: task1
    command: echo "runs in parallel"
  - name: task2
    command: echo "runs in parallel"
```

Alternatively, you can explicitly set empty dependencies for parallel steps:

```yaml
type: graph
steps:
  - name: task1
    command: echo "runs in parallel"
    depends: []
  - name: task2
    command: echo "runs in parallel"
    depends: []
```

### Migration Required

 **History Data Migration**: Due to internal improvements, history data from 1.16.x requires migration:

```bash
# Migrate history data
dagu migrate history
```

After successful migration, legacy history directories are moved to `<DAGU_DATA_DIR>/history_migrated_<timestamp>` for safekeeping.

## v1.16.0 (2025-01-09)

### New Features

####  Enhanced Docker Image
- Base image updated to `ubuntu:24.04`
- Pre-installed common tools: `sudo`, `git`, `curl`, `jq`, `python3`, and more
- Ready for production use with essential utilities

####  Dotenv File Support
Load environment variables from `.env` files:

```yaml
dotenv: /path/to/.env
# or multiple files
dotenv:
  - .env
  - .env.production
```

#### 🔗 JSON Reference Expansion
Access nested JSON values with path syntax:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: sub workflow
    run: sub_workflow
    output: SUB_RESULT
  - name: use output
    command: echo "The result is ${SUB_RESULT.outputs.finalValue}"
```

If `SUB_RESULT` contains:
```json
{
  "outputs": {
    "finalValue": "success"
  }
}
```
Then `${SUB_RESULT.outputs.finalValue}` expands to `success`.

####  Advanced Preconditions

**Regex Support**: Use `re:` prefix for pattern matching:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: some_step
    command: some_command
    preconditions:
      - condition: "`date '+%d'`"
        expected: "re:0[1-9]"  # Run only on days 01-09
```

**Command Preconditions**: Test conditions with commands:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: some_step
    command: some_command
    preconditions:
      - command: "test -f /tmp/some_file"
```

####  Enhanced Parameter Support

**List Format**: Define parameters as key-value pairs:
```yaml
params:
  - PARAM1: value1
  - PARAM2: value2
```

**CLI Flexibility**: Support both named and positional parameters:
```bash
# Positional
dagu start my_dag -- param1 param2

# Named
dagu start my_dag -- PARAM1=value1 PARAM2=value2

# Mixed
dagu start my_dag -- param1 param2 --param3 value3
```

####  Enhanced Continue On Conditions

**Exit Code Matching**:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: some_step
    command: some_command
    continueOn:
      exitCode: [1, 2]  # Continue if exit code is 1 or 2
```

**Mark as Success**:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: some_step
    command: some_command
    continueOn:
      exitCode: 1
      markSuccess: true  # Mark successful even if failed
```

**Output Matching**:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: some_step
    command: some_command
    continueOn:
      output: "WARNING"  # Continue if output contains "WARNING"
      
  # With regex
  - name: another_step
    command: another_command
    continueOn:
      output: "re:^ERROR: [0-9]+"  # Regex pattern matching
```

#### 🐚 Shell Features

**Piping Support**:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: pipe_example
    command: "cat file.txt | grep pattern | wc -l"
```

**Custom Shell Selection**:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: bash_specific
    command: "echo ${BASH_VERSION}"
    shell: bash
    
  - name: python_shell
    command: "print('Hello from Python')"
    shell: python3
```

####  Sub-workflow Output
Parent workflows now receive structured output from sub-workflows:

```json
{
  "name": "some_subworkflow",
  "params": "PARAM1=param1 PARAM2=param2",
  "outputs": {
    "RESULT1": "Some output",
    "RESULT2": "Another output"
  }
}
```

#### 🔗 Simplified Dependencies
String format now supported:
```yaml
type: graph
steps:
  - name: first
    command: echo "First"
  - name: second
    command: echo "Second"
    depends: first  # Simple string instead of array
```

### Improvements

- **Environment Variable Expansion**: Now supported in most DAG fields
- **UI Enhancements**: Improved DAG visualization for better readability
- **Storage Optimization**: Reduced state file sizes by removing redundant data

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed: DAGs with dots (`.`) in names can now be edited in the Web UI
