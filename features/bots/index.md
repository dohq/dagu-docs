# Workflow Operator (Chat Bot)

Workflow Operator is Dagu's persistent chatbot/operator layer for Slack, Telegram, and Discord. These bots act as connectors that map conversations in those platforms to agent sessions, forward messages in both directions, and keep follow-up in the same context.

Only one messaging connector can be active at a time. Technically this is configured via `bots.provider` in the config file or the `DAGU_BOTS_PROVIDER` environment variable.

::: tip Prerequisite
Configure the AI agent first. Go to **Agent Settings** (`/agent-settings`) in the Web UI and set your model, tool policy, and related defaults. Start with [Agent Settings](/features/agent/settings/), then use [Models & Providers](/features/agent/settings/models) and [Tool Permissions & Bash Policy](/features/agent/settings/controls) as needed.

## Available Platforms

| Platform | Connection | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| [Telegram](/features/bots/telegram) | Long polling | Use Workflow Operator from Telegram chat, receive notifications, and continue follow-up in the same conversation |
| [Slack](/features/bots/slack) | Socket Mode (WebSocket) | Use Workflow Operator from Slack channels and threads for operational follow-up without leaving chat |
| [Discord](/features/bots/discord) | Gateway (WebSocket) | Use Workflow Operator from Discord channels and DMs with button-driven prompts and inline notifications |

## Relationship to AI Agent

Workflow Operator is built on top of the same built-in AI agent used in the Web UI.

That means:

- The agent must be enabled first
- A working default model must exist
- Tool permissions and bash policy still apply
- Provider-specific model issues such as local-model endpoint configuration still matter

Start with [Agent Settings](/features/agent/settings/), then return here to configure Slack, Telegram, or Discord.
