# Workflow Operator on Discord

Workflow Operator on Discord uses a Discord bot to map each Discord channel to a persistent Dagu AI agent session over Discord's gateway (WebSocket, no public HTTP endpoint required). Messages sent in Discord are forwarded to the built-in AI agent, and agent responses are posted back. When a DAG run completes, Workflow Operator can also send AI-generated notifications so follow-up stays in the same conversation.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Workflow Operator on Discord, configure the AI agent in the Web UI. Go to **Agent Settings** (`/agent-settings`) and set up the agent model, tool policy, and other defaults first. The Discord bot forwards messages to the built-in agent, so it must be configured before Discord can use it. Start with [Agent Settings](/features/agent/settings/), then use [Models & Providers](/features/agent/settings/models) and [Tool Permissions & Bash Policy](/features/agent/settings/controls) for the concrete setup pieces.

## Creating a Discord App

Before configuring Dagu, you need to create a Discord application and bot user.

### 1. Create the application

1. Go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click **New Application**.
2. Name it (e.g., `Dagu`) and click **Create**.

### 2. Create the bot user

1. In the left sidebar, go to **Bot**.
2. Click **Reset Token** (or **Add Bot** on older-style applications) and copy the token. This is the value for `bots.discord.token` in Dagu config, or the `DAGU_BOTS_DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable. Treat it like a password — it cannot be retrieved again once you leave the page.

### 3. Enable privileged intents

The bot needs to read message content. In the **Bot** tab:

1. Scroll to **Privileged Gateway Intents**.
2. Toggle **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** to ON.
3. Click **Save Changes**.

Without this intent, the bot will receive message events but `Content` will be empty for messages that do not @mention it, and `respond_to_all` will not work.

### 4. Invite the bot to your server

1. In the left sidebar, go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**.
2. Under **Scopes**, check **bot** and (optionally) **applications.commands**.
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, check at least:
   - `View Channels`
   - `Send Messages`
   - `Send Messages in Threads`
   - `Read Message History`
   - `Use Slash Commands` (if you plan to add slash commands)
4. Copy the generated URL, open it in a browser, pick the server, and authorize.

### 5. Finding your Channel ID

1. In Discord, enable **Developer Mode** under **User Settings → Advanced**.
2. Right-click the channel name and choose **Copy Channel ID**. The ID is a numeric string (e.g., `1234567890123456789`). This is what you put in `allowed_channel_ids`.

## Running

The Discord connector for Workflow Operator starts automatically when `bots.provider` is set to `discord` and you run either:

```bash
dagu server
```

or

```bash
dagu start-all
```

In both modes, the connector shares the server's agent API instance.

## Configuration

Set `provider: discord` under `bots` and configure the Discord-specific fields. Only one connector can be active at a time.

```yaml
bots:
  provider: discord
  safe_mode: true
  discord:
    token: "your-discord-bot-token"
    allowed_channel_ids:
      - "1234567890123456789"
      - "9876543210987654321"
    respond_to_all: true
```

### `bots` fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string | `""` (disabled) | Which connector to run. Set to `"discord"` for Discord. If empty, no bot starts. |
| `safe_mode` | bool | `true` | Passed to the agent's `ChatRequest.SafeMode` field. Applies to all bot connectors. |

### `bots.discord` fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `token` | string | (required) | Bot token from the Discord Developer Portal. |
| `allowed_channel_ids` | []string | (required) | Discord channel IDs authorized to use the bot. Messages from other guild channels are silently ignored. Direct messages to the bot are always handled regardless of this list. |
| `respond_to_all` | bool | `true` | When `true`, the bot responds to every message in allowed guild channels. When `false`, the bot only responds to messages that @mention it. DMs are always handled regardless of this setting. |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Config equivalent |
|----------|-------------------|
| `DAGU_BOTS_PROVIDER` | `bots.provider` |
| `DAGU_BOTS_SAFE_MODE` | `bots.safe_mode` |
| `DAGU_BOTS_DISCORD_TOKEN` | `bots.discord.token` |
| `DAGU_BOTS_DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS` | `bots.discord.allowed_channel_ids` |
| `DAGU_BOTS_DISCORD_RESPOND_TO_ALL` | `bots.discord.respond_to_all` |

Environment variables take precedence over the config file for `token`. For `allowed_channel_ids`, use a comma-separated string:

```bash
export DAGU_BOTS_DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS=1234567890123456789,9876543210987654321
```

## Event Handling

The bot subscribes to Discord's gateway and handles two types of events:

### Messages (`MessageCreate`)

- **DMs** (`GuildID == ""`): always handled.
- **Guild channel messages**: only handled when the channel ID is in `allowed_channel_ids`. With `respond_to_all: true`, every message is forwarded to the agent. With `respond_to_all: false`, only messages that @mention the bot are handled — the `<@BOT_ID>` prefix is stripped from the text before it reaches the agent.

Messages authored by bots (including this bot itself) are ignored to avoid loops.

### Interactive Components (Button Presses)

When the agent emits a `UserPrompt` with options, the bot renders it as a message with one or more `ActionsRow` components containing `Button` elements. Each button's `custom_id` is formatted as `prompt:<promptID>:<optionID>`.

When a user clicks a button, the bot submits the selected option to the agent and updates the original message in-place (via `InteractionResponseUpdateMessage`) to show the selection and remove the now-consumed buttons.

Button labels are truncated to 80 characters (Discord's limit for button labels). Up to 5 buttons are shown per row, and up to 5 rows per message — prompts with more than 25 options have the extras silently dropped.

If the prompt allows free text (`AllowFreeText: true`), the user can also reply with a regular text message instead of clicking a button.

### Text Commands

Type these as plain messages (or after @mentioning the bot when `respond_to_all` is false):

| Text | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `new` | Resets the channel's session state and clears the current agent session |
| `cancel` | Cancels the currently active agent session |

Any text starting with `new` or `cancel` is treated as a command. All other text is forwarded to the agent.

## Session Rotation

The bot tracks token usage across all messages in a session. When total tokens exceed 50% of the assumed context limit (200,000 tokens), the bot automatically:

1. Collects the last 3 user/assistant exchanges from the old session (each truncated to 200/300 characters respectively).
2. Resets the chat state.
3. Creates a new session with the summary prepended to the user's message.
4. Sends a notice: `(Session context limit reached — continuing with recent context carried forward)`

## DAG Run Notifications

When the centralized event store is available (the default in both `server` and `start-all` modes), the bot starts a DAG run monitor that reads persisted DAG-run events and sends notifications. If the event store is disabled or unavailable, Discord chat works normally but DAG-run notifications stay disabled.

### Monitored statuses

Notifications are sent for these DAG run statuses:

- `succeeded`
- `failed`
- `aborted`
- `partially_succeeded`
- `rejected`
- `waiting` (for human approval requests)

### How notifications work

1. The monitor polls the event store every **10 seconds** and reads only new DAG-run events, using durable on-disk state so restarts do not lose pending notifications.
2. On first startup, it seeds its cursor at the current event-store head, so existing channels only receive future events.
3. For each new completion, it creates a **dedicated agent session** per allowed channel, sends a structured prompt with the run details (DAG name, status, error, start/finish times, step results), and waits for the agent to generate a notification message (up to **10 minutes**).
4. The notification session is **adopted** as the channel's active session, so users can send follow-up messages like "show me the logs" or "retry it".
5. Delivered entries are retained for **2 hours** to suppress duplicate event replays, while failed deliveries remain pending and are retried.

### Fallback

If the agent API is unavailable or times out, the bot sends a plain text fallback:

```
<emoji> DAG '<name>' <status>
Error: <error message if any>
```

Where the emoji is: `✅` succeeded/partial, `❌` failed/rejected, `⚠️` aborted, `⏳` waiting.

## Message Length

Messages longer than 2,000 characters are split at paragraph boundaries (`\n\n`), falling back to line boundaries (`\n`) if no paragraph break exists in the second half of the text. Discord's message limit for bot content is 2,000 characters per message.

## User Identity

All Discord users are mapped to agent sessions with `auth.RoleAdmin`. The user ID format is `discord:<channel_id>` — the session is scoped to the channel, not to an individual user, so everyone posting in an allowed channel shares the same agent session.
