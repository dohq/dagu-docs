# Agent Step

Run the AI agent as a workflow step. The agent executes a multi-turn tool-calling loop to accomplish the task described in `messages`. It can read files, run commands, edit code, and use provider-native web search when enabled.

## Basic Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - type: agent
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: |
          Analyze the error logs at /var/log/app/errors.log from the last hour.
          Summarize the root causes and suggest fixes.
    output: ANALYSIS_RESULT
```

The agent uses the default model configured in Agent Settings (`/agent-settings`). No per-step model configuration is needed.

## Configuration

The `agent` block is optional. When omitted, the step uses defaults from the global Agent Settings.

```yaml
steps:
  - type: agent
    agent:
      model: claude-sonnet
      tools:
        enabled:
          - bash
          - read
          - patch
      prompt: |
        Focus only on files in /etc/app/.
      max_iterations: 30
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Fix the invalid database_url in /etc/app/config.yaml"
    output: RESULT
```

### `agent` Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | string | global default | Model ID from Agent Settings. Overrides the default model for this step. |
| `tools` | object | — | Tool selection and bash policy. See [Tools](#tools). |
| `skills` | string[] | — | Skill IDs the agent is allowed to use. If omitted, falls back to globally enabled skills. |
| `soul` | string | — | Soul ID for this step's identity. When omitted, inherits from `defaults.agent.soul`. |
| `memory` | object | `{ enabled: false }` | When `enabled: true`, loads global and per-DAG memory into the agent context. See [Memory](/features/agent/memory). |
| `prompt` | string | — | Additional instructions appended to the built-in system prompt. |
| `max_iterations` | int | `50` | Maximum tool-call rounds before the agent stops. |
| `web_search` | object | — | Provider-native web search configuration. Overrides the global agent web search setting. See [Web Search](#web-search). |
| `safe_mode` | bool | `true` | Passed through to the agent loop for compatibility with interactive sessions. Agent steps do not show approval prompts; bash commands denied by policy are blocked. |

## Model Resolution

The agent step resolves its model from the global Agent Settings (configured at `/agent-settings`):

1. If `agent.model` is set in the step, look up that model ID in the global `ModelStore`
2. If `agent.model` is omitted, use the global default model (`DefaultModelID` from Agent Settings)
3. If no default model is configured, the step fails with: `"no model configured; set a default model in Agent Settings or specify agent.model in the step"`

Model configuration (provider, API key, base URL) is managed entirely through Agent Settings. This avoids duplicating credentials in DAG files.

## DAG-Level Defaults

Use `defaults.agent` to set default agent configuration for all agent-type steps in the DAG. Each field is applied only when the step does not set its own value.

```yaml
defaults:
  agent:
    model: claude-opus
    soul: tsumugi
    max_iterations: 30

steps:
  - type: agent
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Analyze the logs"
    # Uses defaults: model=claude-opus, soul=tsumugi, max_iterations=30

  - type: agent
    agent:
      model: claude-sonnet   # overrides defaults.agent.model
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Review the analysis"
    # Uses model=claude-sonnet (override), soul=tsumugi (default), etc.
```

**Resolution order (per field):** `step.agent.<field>` → `defaults.agent.<field>` → built-in default

### Supported Default Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model` | string | Default model ID for agent steps |
| `tools` | object | Default tool selection and bash policy |
| `skills` | string[] | Default skill IDs |
| `soul` | string | Default soul ID |
| `memory` | object | Default memory configuration |
| `prompt` | string | Default additional system prompt instructions |
| `max_iterations` | int | Default max tool-call rounds |
| `safe_mode` | bool | Default safe mode setting. Agent-step deny rules still block without prompting. |

## Tools

### Available Tools

The agent step has access to these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bash` | Execute shell commands (timeout: 120s default, max 600s) |
| `read` | Read file contents with line numbers (max 1MB, 2000 lines default) |
| `patch` | Create, edit, or delete files |
| `think` | Record reasoning without executing actions |
| `use_skill` | Execute a skill from the skill store (available when skills are configured) |
| `search_skills` | Search available skills by query (available when skills are configured) |
| `remote_agent` | Delegate tasks to agents through remote CLI contexts (available when contexts are configured) |
| `list_contexts` | List available remote CLI contexts for `remote_agent` (available when contexts are configured) |
| `output` | Write the final result to stdout (step-only, see [Output Capture](#output-capture)) |

The `navigate`, `ask_user`, and `delegate` tools are not available in agent steps because they require the Web UI.

See [Tools Reference](/features/agent/tools) for full parameter documentation.

### `output` Tool

The `output` tool is unique to agent steps. When the agent calls it, the `content` parameter is written directly to the step's stdout. This is how the step produces its output variable.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `content` | string | Yes | The final result to output. Cannot be empty. |

The `output` tool is always included even if not listed in `tools.enabled`.

### Tool Selection

Tools are filtered in two layers:

1. **Global policy** (from Agent Settings): Tools disabled in the global `ToolPolicy.Tools` are removed. You cannot re-enable a globally-disabled tool at the step level.
2. **Step-level `tools.enabled`**: If specified, only the listed tools are available (intersected with what's globally allowed).

When `tools.enabled` is omitted, all globally-enabled tools are available.

```yaml
agent:
  tools:
    enabled:
      - bash
      - read
      - think
```

If `read` is disabled in global Agent Settings and the step specifies `enabled: [bash, read]`, only `bash` and `output` will be available. The step does not produce a warning for this.

## Bash Policy

Bash command policy rules are loaded from the global Agent Settings and enforced via a `BeforeToolExecHook` on every bash tool call. Rules are evaluated in order; the first matching rule determines the action.

Agent steps do not have an interactive approval UI. If a command is denied by policy, the step receives a policy error instead of a prompt.

### Step-Level Bash Policy

The step can define its own bash policy rules via `tools.bash_policy`:

```yaml
agent:
  tools:
    bash_policy:
      default_behavior: deny
      deny_behavior: block
      rules:
        - name: allow-read-commands
          pattern: "^(cat|head|tail|grep|find|ls)\\b"
          action: allow
        - name: deny-destructive
          pattern: "^(rm|chmod|chown|mkfs)\\b"
          action: deny
```

| Field | Type | Values | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `default_behavior` | string | `allow`, `deny` | Action when no rule matches. Global default: `allow`. |
| `deny_behavior` | string | `ask_user`, `block` | What happens when denied. In agent steps, `ask_user` behaves like `block` because there is no approval UI. Global default: `ask_user`. |
| `rules[].name` | string | — | Human-readable rule name. |
| `rules[].pattern` | string | — | Regex pattern matched against each command segment. Required. |
| `rules[].action` | string | `allow`, `deny` | Action when pattern matches. Required. |

When a bash command is denied, the agent receives: `"Blocked by policy: bash command denied by policy: {reason}"`.

## Web Search

Provider-native web search is configured via the `agent.web_search` field. This uses the LLM provider's built-in web search capability (e.g., Anthropic's web search) rather than a separate tool. When omitted, the step falls back to the global agent web search setting.

```yaml
agent:
  web_search:
    enabled: true
    max_uses: 10
    allowed_domains:
      - docs.example.com
      - github.com
    blocked_domains:
      - reddit.com
    user_location:
      city: San Francisco
      region: California
      country: US
      timezone: America/Los_Angeles
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | Activates provider-native web search. |
| `max_uses` | *int | Limits search invocations per request. |
| `allowed_domains` | string[] | Restricts results to these domains (Anthropic only). |
| `blocked_domains` | string[] | Excludes results from these domains (Anthropic only). |
| `user_location` | object | Localizes search results. Fields: `city`, `region`, `country`, `timezone` (all string). |

## Messages

At least one message is required. Validation fails with `"agent step requires at least one message"` if `messages` is empty.

Message content supports variable substitution with `${VAR}` syntax. Variables are evaluated at runtime via `runtime.EvalString`:

```yaml
params:
  - INPUT_FILE
  - OUTPUT_DIR

steps:
  - type: agent
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Analyze ${INPUT_FILE} and write results to ${OUTPUT_DIR}"
    output: RESULT
```

## Execution

The agent runs as a single-shot loop. It processes the user messages, calls tools as needed, and stops when either:

- The agent finishes processing with no more tool calls (normal completion)
- `max_iterations` is reached (the loop is cancelled)

### Stderr Logging

All agent activity is logged to stderr with `[agent]` prefix. This keeps stdout clean for output capture.

```
[agent] Starting (model: Claude Sonnet, tools: 7, safe_mode: true, max_iterations: 50)
[agent] Tool call: bash {"command":"ls -la /var/log/app/"}
[agent] Tool result: [success, 1234 chars]
[agent] Assistant: I found the following log files...
[agent] Tool call: read {"path":"/var/log/app/errors.log","limit":100}
[agent] Tool result: [success, 5678 chars]
[agent] Completed (2 iterations)
```

Tool call arguments are truncated at 200 characters. Assistant content is truncated at 500 characters with newlines replaced by spaces.

## Output Capture

The step's `output` field captures whatever the agent writes to stdout via the `output` tool:

```yaml
steps:
  - type: agent
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: "Count the number of .go files in this directory"
    output: FILE_COUNT

  - command: echo "Found ${FILE_COUNT} Go files"
```

The agent is instructed (via system prompt) to call the `output` tool with its final result. The content is written directly to stdout and captured by the `output` field.

If the agent never calls the `output` tool, the output variable will be empty.

## Examples
