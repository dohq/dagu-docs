# OpenAI Subscription

This page documents the `openai-codex` provider in the built-in Web UI agent.

In Dagu, this provider uses a stored ChatGPT subscription login, not an OpenAI API key.

The current implementation uses:

- Provider ID: `openai-codex`
- UI label: `OpenAI Codex`
- Auth provider name: `ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex Subscription)`

## What This Provider Uses

For `openai-codex`, Dagu stores an OAuth credential for the selected node and resolves it at request time.

This is different from the `openai` provider:

- `openai` uses an API key
- `openai-codex` uses a ChatGPT subscription login

In the current settings UI and backend:

- API keys are not used for `openai-codex`
- Custom base URLs are not used for `openai-codex`
- A model cannot be created or updated unless the selected node already has a valid `openai-codex` login

At runtime, Dagu sends `openai-codex` agent requests to the Codex backend with the stored access token and ChatGPT account ID.

## Where To Configure It

You can configure this flow in either place:

- `/agent-settings`
- `/setup`

Both UIs use the same backend auth endpoints and the same `ProviderAuthCard` component.

The configuration is scoped to the currently selected node:

- In the Web UI, requests include the current `remoteNode`
- If the app bar is set to `local`, the credential is stored for the local node
- If the app bar is set to a remote node, the credential is stored for that remote node

## Web UI Steps

### 1. Open Agent Settings

Go to `/agent-settings`.

If the built-in agent is disabled, enable it first.

### 2. Connect the subscription

In the **OpenAI Codex** provider card:

1. Click `Connect`
2. Dagu starts a manual OAuth flow and opens the returned `authUrl`
3. Complete the OpenAI login in the browser
4. Paste either:
   - the full redirect URL
   - the authorization code
5. Click `Complete Login`

The UI shows:

- connection status
- masked account ID
- expiry timestamp when available

If the credential expires and refresh is no longer possible, the UI shows `Expired` and you must reconnect.

### 3. Create the model entry

Open **Add Model** and set:

- `Provider`: `OpenAI Codex`
- `Model`: the provider model ID you want Dagu to send, for example `gpt-5.4` or `gpt-5.4-mini`
- `Name`: any display name
- `ID`: any stable model ID, or accept the generated slug

The form does not use `API Key` or `Base URL` for this provider.

The current preset list includes Codex presets such as:

- `GPT-5.4 Codex`
- `GPT-5.4 Codex Mini`

### 4. Set the default model

After the model is created, set it as the default model if you want the built-in agent to use it by default.

The built-in agent uses the default model unless the session selects another saved model.

## Setup Wizard Steps

The setup wizard exposes the same provider.

When `OpenAI Codex` is selected in `/setup`:

- the API key input is not used
- the provider card requires a completed subscription login
- setup creates a model from the selected preset with `provider: openai-codex`

If the provider is not connected, setup stops with:

```text
Connect OpenAI Codex before completing setup
```

## API Flow

All auth endpoints require an authenticated admin user.

### 1. List provider status

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$DAGU_BASE/api/v1/settings/agent/auth/providers?remoteNode=local"
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "id": "openai-codex",
      "name": "ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex Subscription)",
      "connected": true,
      "expiresAt": "2026-04-01T12:34:56Z",
      "canRefresh": true,
      "accountId": "acct_..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Start login

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$DAGU_BASE/api/v1/settings/agent/auth/providers/openai-codex/login?remoteNode=local"
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "flowId": "random-flow-id",
  "authUrl": "https://auth.openai.com/oauth/authorize?...",
  "instructions": "Open the URL in your browser. After authentication, copy the full redirect URL or the authorization code and paste it back into Dagu."
}
```

### 3. Complete login with the pasted redirect URL

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$DAGU_BASE/api/v1/settings/agent/auth/providers/openai-codex/login/complete?remoteNode=local" \
  -d '{
    "flowId": "random-flow-id",
    "redirectUrl": "http://localhost:1455/auth/callback?code=...&state=..."
  }'
```

You can also complete the flow with `code` instead of `redirectUrl`:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$DAGU_BASE/api/v1/settings/agent/auth/providers/openai-codex/login/complete?remoteNode=local" \
  -d '{
    "flowId": "random-flow-id",
    "code": "authorization-code"
  }'
```

The request schema requires:

- `flowId`
- at least one of `redirectUrl` or `code`

### 4. Create the model

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$DAGU_BASE/api/v1/settings/agent/models?remoteNode=local" \
  -d '{
    "id": "gpt-5-4-codex",
    "name": "GPT-5.4 Codex",
    "provider": "openai-codex",
    "model": "gpt-5.4",
    "supportsThinking": true,
    "thinkingEffort": "high"
  }'
```

For this provider:

- the backend clears `apiKey`
- the backend clears `baseUrl`
- the backend validates that `openai-codex` is already connected for the selected node

### 5. Set the default model

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$DAGU_BASE/api/v1/settings/agent/default-model?remoteNode=local" \
  -d '{
    "modelId": "gpt-5-4-codex"
  }'
```

## What Dagu Sends For This Provider

For the built-in agent runtime, `openai-codex` requests use:

- bearer token from the stored OAuth credential
- ChatGPT account ID extracted from the OAuth token
- provider model ID from the saved model entry

When `thinkingEffort` is set on the model and `supportsThinking` is enabled, Dagu includes:

```json
{
  "reasoning": {
    "effort": "low|medium|high|xhigh",
    "summary": "auto"
  }
}
```

If `thinkingEffort` is empty, Dagu does not force a reasoning effort in the request body.

## Disconnect

To remove the stored subscription login for the selected node:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$DAGU_BASE/api/v1/settings/agent/auth/providers/openai-codex/login?remoteNode=local"
```

Disconnecting the provider does not delete saved model entries. It only removes the stored OAuth credential.
