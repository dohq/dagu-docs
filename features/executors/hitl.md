# HITL (Human in the Loop)

Pause workflow execution until human approval is granted. The `hitl` executor enables human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows where manual review or authorization is required before proceeding.

## Basic Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - command: ./deploy.sh staging
  - type: hitl
  - command: ./deploy.sh production
```

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `prompt` | string | Message displayed to the approver in the UI |
| `input` | string[] | Parameter names to collect from the approver |
| `required` | string[] | Parameters that must be provided (subset of `input`) |

## How It Works

1. When a HITL step executes, it immediately enters `Waiting` status
2. The workflow pauses and the DAG status becomes `Wait`
3. Subsequent steps remain in `Not Started` status until approval
4. Approval can be granted via the Web UI or REST API
5. Upon approval, the HITL step succeeds and execution continues

## Examples

### With Prompt

```yaml
steps:
  - command: ./deploy.sh staging
  - type: hitl
    config:
      prompt: "Staging verified. Approve production?"
  - command: ./deploy.sh production
```

### Collecting Inputs

Collected parameters become environment variables in subsequent steps:

```yaml
steps:
  - type: hitl
    config:
      prompt: "Provide deployment details."
      input: [APPROVED_BY, RELEASE_NOTES]
      required: [APPROVED_BY]
  - command: |
      echo "Approved by: ${APPROVED_BY}"
      ./deploy.sh
```

### Parallel Branches

Use `type: graph` when you need parallel branches with approval gates:

```yaml
type: graph

steps:
  # Branch A - requires approval
  - name: approval
    type: hitl

  - name: migrate
    command: ./migrate.sh
    depends: [approval]

  # Branch B - runs independently
  - name: report
    command: ./report.sh
```

Branch B executes while Branch A waits for approval.

### Multiple Gates

```yaml
steps:
  - command: ./build.sh
  - type: hitl
    config:
      prompt: "QA: Approve for staging?"
  - command: ./deploy.sh staging
  - type: hitl
    config:
      prompt: "Release manager: Approve for production?"
  - command: ./deploy.sh production
```

## Approval Methods

### Web UI

1. Navigate to the DAG run in the Dagu web interface
2. The HITL step displays with "Waiting" status
3. Click the step to view the prompt and input fields
4. Fill in any required inputs and click "Approve"

### REST API

Approve a HITL step programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/v2/dag-runs/{name}/{dagRunId}/steps/{stepName}/approve" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "inputs": {
      "APPROVED_BY": "john@example.com",
      "RELEASE_NOTES": "Bug fixes for v2.1"
    }
  }'
```

## Email Notifications

Configure email notifications when a workflow enters wait status:

```yaml
smtp:
  host: smtp.example.com
  port: "587"
  username: ${SMTP_USER}
  password: ${SMTP_PASSWORD}

waitMail:
  from: dagu@example.com
  to:
    - approvers@example.com
  prefix: "[APPROVAL REQUIRED]"

steps:
  - name: approval
    type: hitl
    config:
      prompt: "Please approve the deployment."
```

See [Email Notifications](/features/email-notifications) for more details.

## Wait Handler

Execute custom logic when the workflow enters wait status:

```yaml
handlerOn:
  wait:
    command: |
      echo "Waiting steps: ${DAG_WAITING_STEPS}"
      curl -X POST https://slack.com/webhook \
        -d '{"text": "Approval required for ${DAG_NAME}"}'

steps:
  - name: approval
    type: hitl
```

The `DAG_WAITING_STEPS` environment variable contains a comma-separated list of waiting step names.

See [Lifecycle Handlers](/writing-workflows/lifecycle-handlers) for more details.

## Limitations

- HITL steps cannot be used with `workerSelector` (distributed execution) because approval state is stored locally
- Sub-DAG wait status does not propagate to parent DAG nodes (the sub-DAG will show as failed if it contains HITL steps)
