# What is Dagu?

</div>

Dagu is a local-first workflow engine. It is declarative, file-based, self-contained, and air-gapped ready. It runs as a single binary and scales from laptop to distributed cluster.

## Key Capabilities

- **Single binary deployment** - Install and run without external services
- **Declarative YAML** - JSON Schema validation with clear error messages
- **Composable workflows** - Nest sub-DAGs with parameters (depth limited only by available memory)
- **Distributed execution** - Route tasks to workers via labels (GPU, region, etc.)
- **Built-in scheduling** - Cron expressions with start/stop/restart support
- **Slack & Telegram bots** - Manage workflows and debug issues through chat
- **Web UI** - Monitor, control, and debug workflows in real-time

## AI Agent

Dagu includes a built-in LLM-powered agent that can read, create, and modify your workflows. Use it interactively through the Web UI chat, or add `type: agent` steps to your DAGs for automation.

- **Create and update workflows** — describe what you need; the agent generates valid DAG YAML, validates it against the schema, and opens it in the UI
- **Debug and fix failures** — point the agent at a failed run; it reads logs, suggests probable causes, and can patch configurations
- **Answer questions** — ask what a DAG does, how to configure an executor, or why a step failed

The agent runs as an LLM tool-calling loop with configurable tools (shell execution, file read/write, schema lookup, sub-agent delegation) and safety controls (RBAC enforcement, per-tool enable/disable, regex-based bash command policies). Results are non-deterministic and should be reviewed.

Bring your own model: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, and local servers (Ollama, vLLM) are supported. Models and API keys are configured in the Web UI at `/agent-settings`.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: analyze_logs
    type: agent
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: |
          Analyze the error logs at /var/log/app/errors.log from the last hour.
          Summarize the root causes and suggest fixes.
    output: ANALYSIS_RESULT
```

See [Agent Overview](/features/agent/) and [Agent Step](/features/agent/step) for full documentation.

## Slack & Telegram Bots

Talk to the AI agent directly from Slack or Telegram. The bot bridges your messaging platform with the built-in agent, so you can manage workflows without opening the Web UI.

- **Debug issues** - ask the agent to check logs and diagnose failures
- **Recover from incidents** - re-run workflows with adjusted parameters through chat
- **Get notified** - receive DAG run completion notifications with AI-generated summaries
- **Approve actions** - respond to approval gates via interactive buttons in Slack or Telegram

Each conversation maps to a persistent agent session. The bot supports safe mode with configurable bash command policies.

```yaml
# Enable Telegram bot
bots:
  provider: telegram

telegram:
  token: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
  allowed_chats:
    - 123456789
```

See [Bots](/features/bots/) for setup instructions.

## How It Works

Dagu executes workflows defined as steps in YAML. Steps form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), ensuring predictable execution order.

### Sequential Execution

```yaml
type: chain
steps:
  - command: echo "Step 1"
  - command: echo "Step 2"
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Step 1"] --> B["Step 2"]
    style A stroke:green,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
    style B stroke:lime,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
```

### Parallel Execution

```yaml
type: graph
steps:
  - id: step_1
    command: echo "Step 1"
  - id: step_2a
    command: echo "Step 2a"
    depends: [step_1]
  - id: step_2b
    command: echo "Step 2b"
    depends: [step_1]
  - id: step_3
    command: echo "Step 3"
    depends: [step_2a, step_2b]
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[step_1] --> B[step_2a]
    A --> C[step_2b]
    B --> D[step_3]
    C --> D
    style A stroke:green,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
    style B stroke:lime,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
    style C stroke:lime,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
    style D stroke:lightblue,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
```

## Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Interfaces["User Interfaces"]
        CLI[CLI]
        UI[Web UI]
        API[REST API]
    end

    subgraph Engine["Core Engine"]
        SCH[Scheduler]
        AGT[Agent]
        EXE[Executors]
    end

    subgraph Distributed["Distributed Mode"]
        COORD[Coordinator]
        W1["Worker 1"]
        WN["Worker N"]
    end

    CLI --> AGT
    UI --> AGT
    API --> AGT
    SCH --> AGT
    AGT --> EXE
    SCH -.->|gRPC| COORD
    COORD --> W1
    COORD --> WN
```

**Local mode**: CLI, Web UI, or API triggers the Agent, which runs steps via Executors.

**Distributed mode**: Scheduler dispatches work to a Coordinator, which routes tasks to Workers based on label selectors (e.g., `gpu=true`, `region=us-east`).

See [Architecture](/overview/architecture) for details.

## Built-in Step Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `command` | Shell commands (bash, sh, PowerShell, cmd) |
| `agent` | LLM-powered agent with tool-calling loop |
| `ssh` | Remote command execution via SSH |
| `docker` | Container execution with volume mounts and registry auth |
| `http` | HTTP/REST API requests |
| `approval` | Human approval gate (field on any step type) |
| `jq` | JSON query and transformation |
| `mail` | Email notifications with attachments |
| `dag` | Sub-workflow execution (hierarchical composition) |

See [Step Types Reference](/step-types/shell) for configuration details.
