title: What is Dagu?
---

<div class="overview-hero">
  <div class="overview-hero-copy">
    <h2>Local-first workflow engine for production scripts</h2>
    <p>
      Define workflows in simple declarative YAML syntax, execute them anywhere with a single binary, compose complex pipelines from reusable sub-workflows, and distribute tasks across workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The built-in Web UI eliminates the need to SSH into servers to debug failed runs, check logs, or retry steps manually, while keeping runs, step logs, artifacts, and history visible in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      No database required. No message broker. No code changes to your existing scripts. Run commands over SSH, Docker containers, Kubernetes jobs, and custom step types for your specific use case.

  <strong>Dagu makes existing ops commands easy to inspect, rerun, and manage.</strong>
  <span>Keep the underlying scripts and commands, define the workflow in YAML, inspect every step in the browser, and rerun or approve operational work without SSHing into servers or chasing crontabs.</span>
</div>

## Motivation

Many environments grow into hundreds of cron jobs and shell scripts on large servers. The jobs may be important, but their dependencies are hidden in crontabs, comments, filenames, and operator knowledge. When one job fails, it is hard to know which downstream jobs were affected, which script should be rerun, and where the relevant logs are.

Dagu was built for teams that already have important automation but lack a practical way to manage it in one place. Instead of asking teams to translate scripts and jobs into a platform-specific model, Dagu wraps existing commands with scheduling, visible dependencies, execution status, logs, retries, approvals, and Web UI controls.

## Core Terminology

Understanding Dagu is easier once the main terms are clear.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **DAG** | A workflow file written in [YAML](/writing-workflows/yaml-specification). Steps run according to dependencies, so the execution order is explicit. |
| **Step** | One unit of work. A step can run a [command](/step-types/shell), [container](/step-types/docker), [SSH command](/step-types/ssh), [HTTP request](/step-types/http), [SQL query](/step-types/sql/), [sub-workflow](/writing-workflows/control-flow), or [AI agent task](/features/agent/step). |
| **Step type** | The kind of work a step runs, such as [`command`](/step-types/shell), [`docker`](/step-types/docker), [`kubernetes`](/step-types/kubernetes), [`ssh`](/step-types/ssh), [`http`](/step-types/http), [`postgres`](/step-types/sql/postgresql), [`s3`](/step-types/s3), or [`agent`](/features/agent/step). You can also define custom step types with the [`step_types`](/writing-workflows/custom-step-types) field. |
| **Run** | One execution of a DAG. Runs keep [status](/web-ui/cockpit), [logs](/overview/web-ui#run-history-and-logs), [timing](/overview/web-ui#run-details), [outputs](/writing-workflows/outputs), and [artifacts](/writing-workflows/artifacts). |
| **Schedule** | [Cron-based automation](/writing-workflows/scheduling) for starting DAG runs, including timezone support. |
| **Queue** | [Concurrency control](/server-admin/queues) for workflows, useful when jobs must not overlap or when workers are shared. |
| **Worker** | A machine that executes tasks in [distributed mode](/server-admin/distributed/). Workers can be selected by [labels](/server-admin/distributed/worker-labels) such as region, GPU, or environment. |
| **Artifact** | A file produced by a run and stored with the [run history](/getting-started/cli#history) for [preview, download, or audit](/writing-workflows/artifacts). |

See [Core Concepts](/getting-started/concepts) for the deeper model.

## How a Workflow Runs

Dagu keeps the workflow definition separate from the code it executes. Your scripts, containers, or services stay the same. Dagu wraps them with scheduling, dependencies, logs, retries, and recovery controls.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: fetch_orders
    command: python scripts/fetch_orders.py

  - id: normalize
    command: python scripts/normalize.py

  - id: load_warehouse
    type: postgres
    with:
      dsn: "${WAREHOUSE_DSN}"
    command: "CALL load_daily_orders()"
```

<div class="overview-lifecycle" aria-label="Dagu workflow lifecycle">
  <span>Write YAML</span>
  <span>Validate</span>
  <span>Schedule or Run</span>
  <span>Monitor</span>
  <span>Retry or Approve</span>
  <span>Notify and Audit</span>
</div>

During a run, Dagu resolves dependencies, starts ready steps, captures stdout and stderr, tracks status, applies retry rules, stores artifacts, and updates the Web UI in real time.

## Why Teams Choose Dagu

The main reason teams choose Dagu is that it modernizes existing operations automation without turning that work into a platform rollout.

## Architecture at a Glance

Dagu can run in a small local setup or scale out when workloads grow. The operating model changes, but the workflow YAML does not need to be rewritten.

<div class="overview-mode-grid">
  <div class="overview-mode-card">
    <h3>Standalone</h3>
    <p><code>dagu start-all</code> runs the Web UI, scheduler, and workflow runtime in one process.</p>
    <p>Best for one server, a team utility box, a private automation host, or getting started quickly.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overview-mode-card">
    <h3>Headless</h3>
    <p>Run workflows from the CLI or API without relying on the Web UI.</p>
    <p>Best for CI-like automation, locked-down servers, or environments where Dagu is managed by another system.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="overview-mode-card">
    <h3>Coordinator and Workers</h3>
    <p>The scheduler queues work, the coordinator assigns tasks, and workers execute DAGs over gRPC.</p>
    <p>Best for many machines, GPU jobs, regional routing, mixed workloads, and high-throughput batch processing.</p>

## Real-World Use Cases

Dagu is useful anywhere existing scripts, containers, operational tasks, or agent-driven jobs need scheduling, retries, visibility, and a safe way for a team to run them.

## AI Agent Workflows and Workflow Operator

Dagu includes AI features, but they build on the same command-native workflow model. The agent can read, create, update, and debug DAGs. Agent steps and external agent CLIs can also run inside workflows, with the same scheduling, logs, retries, approvals, and run history as any other step.

```yaml
steps:
  - id: analyze_logs
    type: agent
    messages:
      - role: user
        content: |
          Analyze /var/log/app/errors.log from the last hour.
          Summarize likely causes and suggest a safe recovery plan.
    output: ANALYSIS_RESULT
```

Workflow Operator connects Slack or Telegram to the built-in steward, so teams can ask for run status, debug failures, re-run workflows, and approve actions from chat.

- [Steward Overview](/features/agent/) explains interactive workflow generation and debugging.
- [Agent Step](/features/agent/step) explains how to run agent tasks inside DAGs.
- [Workflow Operator](/features/bots/) explains Slack and Telegram operation.
