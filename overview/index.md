Dagu is a lightweight workflow engine built in a single binary with modern Web UI. Define any workflow in a simple, declarative YAML format and execute arbitrary workflows on schedule. Natively support shell commands, remote execution via SSH, and docker image. Dagu is a lightweight alternative to Cron, Airflow, Rundeck, etc.

### How it Works
Dagu executes your workflows, which are defined as a series of steps in a YAML file. These steps form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), ensuring a clear and predictable flow of execution.

For example, a simple sequential DAG:
```yaml
type: chain
steps:
  - command: echo "Hello, dagu!"
  - command: echo "This is a second step"
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Hello, dagu!"] --> B["This is a second step"]
    style A stroke:green,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
    style B stroke:lime,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
```

With parallel steps:
```yaml
type: graph
steps:
  - id: step_1
    command: echo "Step 1"
  - id: step_2a
    command: echo "Step 2a - runs in parallel"
    depends: [step_1]
  - id: step_2b
    command: echo "Step 2b - runs in parallel"
    depends: [step_1]
  - id: step_3
    command: echo "Step 3 - waits for parallel steps"
    depends: [step_2a, step_2b]
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[step_1] --> B[step_2a]
    A --> C[step_2b]
    B --> D[step_3]
    C --> D
    style A stroke:green,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
    style B stroke:lime,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
    style C stroke:lime,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
    style D stroke:lightblue,stroke-width:1.6px,color:#333
```
