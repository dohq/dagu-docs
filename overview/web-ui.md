# Web UI

Use Dagu's web UI to run workflows, inspect results, edit DAGs, review logs, and manage the server from a browser.

## Start the UI

```bash
dagu start-all
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

To bind a different address or port:

```bash
dagu start-all --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000
```

## Main Areas

Dagu's UI is organized around a few everyday jobs:

- **Cockpit** for a live board of recent runs
- **Dashboard** for recent activity and trends
- **Definitions** for the list of workflows
- **Run details** for outputs, artifacts, logs, and retries
- **Docs** for markdown documents and runbooks
- **Search** for finding workflows and documents quickly
- **System Status** for scheduler, coordinator, worker, and resource health

## Workspace Selector

The workspace selector sits at the top of the navigation and affects workspace-aware pages such as Cockpit, Dashboard, Definitions, Runs, Search, Design, and Docs.

![Workspace selector](/web-ui-workspace-selector-demo.png)

You can switch between:

- **all** to see everything your account can access
- **default** to see items with no named workspace
- **A named workspace** such as `ops`

See [Workspaces](/web-ui/workspaces) for the full behavior and admin setup.

## Cockpit

Cockpit is the quickest way to watch what is happening right now.

![Cockpit](/cockpit.png)

Use it when you want to:

- scan today’s runs by status
- spot failures or stuck work quickly
- open run details without leaving the board
- start or enqueue workflows from the template picker

See [Cockpit](/web-ui/cockpit) for the dedicated guide.

## Steward

The built-in steward helps with workflow authoring, debugging, and day-to-day operations directly in the UI.

![Steward Chat](/agent-modal.png)

Typical uses:

- draft or edit DAG YAML
- explain failures and suggest fixes
- navigate to related pages
- work with local files when allowed by policy

Configure it from `/agent-settings`.

See [Steward](/features/agent/) for the full setup and usage guide.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard gives you a broader operations view than Cockpit.

![Dashboard](/dashboard.png)

Use it to review:

- recent workflow activity
- success and failure patterns
- filtered run lists by status, date, and name

## Definitions

The Definitions page lists every workflow you can access and shows its current state.

![Definitions](/dag-definitions.png)

This is the best place to:

- browse workflows by workspace
- open a DAG for details or editing
- start or enqueue a workflow from its detail view
- see whether a workflow is scheduled, suspended, or recently failed

## Workflow Details

Open any workflow from **Definitions** to inspect its latest run, schedule, webhook settings, history, and YAML.

![DAG Details](/dag-status.png)

From this page you can usually:

- start, stop, or retry runs
- review the latest graph or timeline
- inspect step-level status
- move between **Latest Run**, **Spec**, **Webhook**, and **History**

## Run Details

When you open a specific run, Dagu shows the full execution view.

![Execution Details](/status-details.png)

This is where you troubleshoot and verify results:

- **Status** for the graph and step table
- **Timeline** for execution ordering and duration
- **Outputs** for collected output values
- **Artifacts** for generated files
- **Logs** for the run and each step

The dedicated outputs view is also available inside the run screen:

![Outputs Tab](/outputs-tab.png)

The same run details screen also includes an Artifacts tab for generated files. Markdown, text, and image artifacts can be previewed inline without leaving the page, and files can be downloaded from the tab:

![Artifacts Tab](/artifacts-tab-light.png)

See [Artifacts](/writing-workflows/artifacts) for configuration, storage, and API details.

## Run History And Logs

Use workflow history when you want to compare multiple attempts of the same DAG:

![Execution History](/dag-history.png)

Use the log view when you want the detailed text output for a run or a single step:

![Execution Log](/dag-logs.png)

## DAG Editor

You can edit workflow YAML directly in the browser when your role allows writes.

![DAG Editor](/dag-editor.png)

The editor includes:

- YAML editing with validation
- schema-aware help and completion
- save actions tied to normal DAG permissions

## Search

Search helps when you know roughly what you need but not exactly where it lives.

![Search](/search.png)

You can search:

- **DAGs** for workflow definitions
- **Docs** for markdown content when document management is enabled

## Documents

The Documents page is Dagu's built-in markdown workspace for runbooks, reports, and generated documents.

![Documents](/docs.png)

Common workflows:

- maintain team runbooks
- keep operating notes next to workflows
- publish run-generated markdown with `DAG_DOCS_DIR`
- browse and preview documents by workspace

See [Documents](/web-ui/documents) for the dedicated guide.

## API Docs

The **API Docs** page exposes the REST API reference from inside the application.

![API Docs](/web-ui-api-docs-demo.png)

Use it when you need to:

- inspect endpoints before automating a task
- check request and response shapes
- test ideas before wiring them into scripts or CI

For the narrative API overview, see [API](/overview/api). For the full generated reference, see [Web UI API](/web-ui/api).

## System Status

System Status shows the health of the scheduler, coordinator, and the current machine.

![Workers](/workers.webp)

This page helps you verify:

- scheduler and coordinator availability
- connected workers
- current CPU, memory, disk, and load trends

If you use distributed execution, this is the first place to look when workers appear missing or overloaded.

## Admin Pages

Depending on your role and license, the navigation can also include pages such as:

- **Users**
- **API Keys**
- **Remote Nodes**
- **Base Config**
- **Events**
- **Audit Logs**
- **License**

These pages are intended for administrators and operators rather than day-to-day workflow users.

## Optional Features

### Terminal

The browser terminal is disabled by default. Enable it only in environments where shell access through the UI is acceptable.

```yaml
terminal:
  enabled: true
  max_sessions: 5
```

### Remote Nodes

Remote nodes let one Dagu UI manage multiple Dagu servers.

```yaml
remote_nodes:
  - name: production
    api_base_url: https://prod.example.com/api/v1
    auth_type: token
    auth_token: ${PROD_TOKEN}
```

### Branding

You can adjust the title and accent color shown in the navigation bar.

```yaml
ui:
  navbar_title: "My Workflows"
  navbar_color: "#00D9FF"
```

## Security Notes

- Enable authentication before exposing the UI outside a trusted network.
- Use HTTPS for any remote or shared deployment.
- Treat terminal access and write access as admin-level capabilities.
