## What is Dagu?

**Dagu is a batteries-included workflow engine that doesn't get in your way.** Define workflows in simple YAML, execute them anywhere with a single binary, compose complex pipelines from reusable sub-workflows, and distribute tasks across workers. Do all this without requiring databases, message brokers, or code changes to your existing scripts.

Built for developers who want powerful workflow orchestration without the operational overhead.

## Why Dagu?

### 🚀 Zero Dependencies
**Single binary. No database, no message broker.** Deploy anywhere in seconds, from your laptop to bare metal servers to Kubernetes. Everything is stored in plain files (XDG compliant), making it transparent, portable, and easy to backup. [Learn more](/getting-started/quickstart)

### 🧩 Composable Nested Workflows
**Build complex pipelines from reusable building blocks.** Define sub-workflows that can be called with parameters, executed in parallel, and fully monitored in the UI. See execution traces for every nested level. No black boxes. [Learn more](/writing-workflows/basics#calling-sub-dags)

### 🌐 Language Agnostic
**Use your existing scripts without modification.** No need to wrap everything in Python decorators or rewrite logic. Dagu orchestrates shell commands, Docker containers, SSH commands, or HTTP calls. Use whatever you already have. [Learn more](/writing-workflows/basics)

### ⚡ Distributed Execution
**Built-in queue system with intelligent task routing.** Route tasks to workers based on labels (GPU, region, compliance requirements). Automatic service registry and health monitoring included. No external coordination service needed. [Learn more](/features/distributed-execution)

### 🎯 Production Ready
**Not a toy.** Battle-tested error handling with exponential backoff retries, lifecycle hooks (onSuccess, onFailure, onExit), real-time log streaming, email notifications, Prometheus metrics, and OpenTelemetry tracing out of the box. Built-in user management with role-based access control (RBAC) for team environments. [Learn more](/configurations/operations)

### 🎨 Modern Web UI
**Beautiful UI that actually helps you debug.** Live log tailing, DAG visualization with Gantt charts, execution history with full lineage, and drill-down into nested sub-workflows. Dark mode included. [Learn more](/configurations/server)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dagu

::: code-group

```bash [macOS/Linux]
# Install to ~/.local/bin (default, no sudo required)
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash

# Install specific version
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash -s -- --version v1.17.0

# Install to custom directory
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash -s -- --install-dir /usr/local/bin
```

```powershell [Windows]
# Install latest version to default location (%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\dagu)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.ps1 | iex

# Install specific version
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.ps1))) v1.24.0
```

```bash [Docker]
docker run --rm \
  -v ~/.dagu:/var/lib/dagu \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/dagu-org/dagu:latest \
  dagu start-all
```

```bash [Homebrew]
brew update && brew install dagu
```

```bash [npm]
npm install -g --ignore-scripts=false @dagu-org/dagu
```

:::

### 2. Create your first workflow

> **Note**: When you first start Dagu with an empty DAGs directory, it automatically creates example workflows to help you get started. To skip this, set `DAGU_SKIP_EXAMPLES=true`.

```bash
cat > ./hello.yaml << 'EOF'
steps:
  - echo "Hello from Dagu!"
  - echo "Running step 2"
EOF
```

### 3. Run the workflow

```bash
dagu start hello.yaml
```

### 4. Start the Web UI

```bash
dagu start-all
```

## Key Features

### [Composable Nested Workflows](/writing-workflows/basics#calling-sub-dags)

Break complex workflows into reusable, maintainable sub-workflows:

```yaml
description: |
  data-pipeline: Extract, transform, and load data daily with retries and parallelism.
schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
type: graph

steps:
  # Extract raw data
  - name: extract
    command: python extract.py --date=${DATE}
    output: RAW_DATA

  # Transform in parallel for each data type
  - name: transform
    call: transform-data
    parallel:
      items: [customers, orders, products, inventory]
    params: "TYPE=${ITEM} INPUT=${RAW_DATA}"
    depends: extract

  # Load to warehouse with retry
  - name: load
    command: python load.py --batch=${RAW_DATA}
    depends: transform
    retryPolicy:
      limit: 3
      intervalSec: 10
      backoff: true

---
# Reusable sub-workflow
name: transform-data
params: [TYPE, INPUT]

steps:
  - name: validate
    command: python validate.py --type=${TYPE} --input=${INPUT}
    
  - name: transform
    command: python transform.py --type=${TYPE} --input=${INPUT}
    output: TRANSFORMED
    
  - name: quality-check
    command: python quality_check.py --data=${TRANSFORMED}
```

**Every sub-workflow run is tracked and visible in the UI with full execution lineage.**

### [Distributed Execution with Worker Labels](/features/distributed-execution)

Route tasks to specialized workers without managing infrastructure:

```yaml
description: |
  ML pipeline that preprocesses data on CPU workers and trains models on GPU workers.
workerSelector:
  gpu: "true"
  cuda: "11.8"
  memory: "64G"

steps:
  - name: preprocess
    command: python preprocess.py
    workerSelector:
      cpu-only: "true"  # Override for CPU task
    
  - name: train
    command: python train.py --gpu
    # Uses parent workerSelector (GPU worker)
    
  - name: evaluate
    call: model-evaluation
    params: "MODEL_PATH=/models/latest"
```

Start workers with labels:
```bash
# GPU worker
dagu worker --worker.labels gpu=true,cuda=11.8,memory=64G

# CPU worker  
dagu worker --worker.labels cpu-only=true,region=us-east-1
```

**Automatic service registry, health monitoring, and task redistribution included.**

### [Advanced Error Handling](/writing-workflows/error-handling)

Production-grade retry policies and lifecycle hooks:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: api-call
    executor:
      type: http
      config:
        method: POST
        url: https://api.example.com/process
        timeout: 30s
    retryPolicy:
      limit: 5
      intervalSec: 2
      backoff: true  # Exponential backoff
    continueOn:
      failure: true  # Keep going even if this fails

handlerOn:
  success:
    command: slack-notify.sh "✅ Pipeline succeeded"
    
  failure:
    executor:
      type: mail
      config:
        to: oncall@company.com
        from: alerts@company.com
        subject: "🚨 ALERT: Pipeline Failure - ${DAG_NAME}"
        message: |
          Pipeline failed.
          Run ID: ${DAG_RUN_ID}
          Check logs: ${DAG_RUN_LOG_FILE}
      
  exit:
    command: cleanup-temp-files.sh  # Always runs
```

### [Builtin Executors](/reference/executors)

Execute task in different ways.

```yaml
steps:
  # Shell command
  - name: local-script
    command: ./deploy.sh
    
  # Docker container
  - name: data-processing
    executor:
      type: docker
      config:
        image: python:3.11
        autoRemove: true
    command: python process.py
    
  # Remote SSH
  - name: remote-deploy
    executor:
      type: ssh
      config:
        user: ubuntu
        host: prod-server.internal
    command: sudo systemctl restart app
    
  # HTTP API call
  - name: trigger-webhook
    executor:
      type: http
      config:
        method: POST
        url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxx
        
  # JSON processing
  - name: parse-config
    executor:
      type: jq
      config:
        query: '.environments[] | select(.name=="prod")'
    command: cat config.json
```

## Use Cases

### 🔄 Data Pipelines
Extract, transform, and load data with complex dependencies. Use nested workflows for reusable transformations and parallel processing.

### 🤖 ML Workflows
Train models on GPU workers, preprocess on CPU workers, and orchestrate the entire lifecycle with automatic retries and versioning.

### 🚀 Deployment Automation
Multi-environment deployments (dev → staging → prod) with approval gates, rollback support, and notification integrations.

### 📊 ETL/ELT
Replace brittle cron jobs with visible, maintainable workflows. Visualize data lineage and debug failures with live logs.

### 🔧 Legacy System Migration
Wrap existing shell scripts and Perl code in Dagu workflows without rewriting them. Add retry logic, monitoring, and scheduling incrementally.

### ☁️ Multi-Cloud Orchestration
Route tasks to workers in different cloud regions based on compliance requirements, data locality, or cost optimization.
