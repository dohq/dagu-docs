# Mail

Send emails from your workflows for notifications, alerts, and reports.

## Basic Usage

```yaml
smtp:
  host: "smtp.gmail.com"
  port: "587"
  username: "${SMTP_USER}"
  password: "${SMTP_PASS}"

steps:
  - type: mail
    config:
      to: recipient@example.com
      from: sender@example.com
      subject: "Workflow Completed"
      message: "The data processing workflow has completed successfully."
```

## SMTP Configuration

Configure SMTP at DAG-level for all mail steps. For global configuration, see [Email Notifications](/writing-workflows/email-notifications#smtp-configuration).

### Common Providers

```yaml
# Gmail
smtp:
  host: "smtp.gmail.com"
  port: "587"
  username: "your-email@gmail.com"
  password: "app-specific-password"  # Not regular password

# Office 365
smtp:
  host: "smtp.office365.com"
  port: "587"
  username: "${SMTP_USER}"
  password: "${SMTP_PASS}"

# AWS SES
smtp:
  host: "email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
  port: "587"
  username: "${AWS_SES_SMTP_USER}"
  password: "${AWS_SES_SMTP_PASSWORD}"
```

### Variable Expansion

`${VAR}` references in `smtp` fields expand only DAG-scoped variables (`env:`, `params:`, `secrets:`, step outputs). OS environment variables are **not** expanded. If your SMTP credentials come from the OS environment, import them in the `env:` block:

```yaml
env:
  - SMTP_USER: ${SMTP_USER}  # Import from OS environment
  - SMTP_PASS: ${SMTP_PASS}

smtp:
  host: "smtp.gmail.com"
  port: "587"
  username: "${SMTP_USER}"  # Expanded — DAG-scoped
  password: "${SMTP_PASS}"
```

## Examples

      message: "The daily report has been generated."

  - type: mail
    config:
      to: admin@example.com  # Single recipient still works
